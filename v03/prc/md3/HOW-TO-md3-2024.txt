		     2024 final qc'd md3 from md2
			       20250308


I blew away the terminal with all the commands I used today to make
the final 2024 :(

this is a reconstruction from memory,,,

1) on mike6 w2-md-md3-redo.py 2024 -2 & -1

2) rsync to mike5

3) c.sb.m3 /sbt/superBT/v03/prc/md3/

needed h-md3-sum.txt and h-md3-all.txt as header for .csv files

* run m-md3-stm-dir-sum.py 2024
--> runs m-md3-from-md2.py

# makes the directory structure in src-v03/2024/bbbb/ and the
  input???-sum*.txt from md2

* run m-md3-mrg-stm-dir-sum.py to create -MRG.txt files

* run m-md3-csv-ALL.py to make the year .csv files

* run m-md3-qc-ALL.py by basin, e.g., m-md3-qc-ALL.py -S w.24

# this does the speed check and cleanup

* do md3a -S all.24 -s -b | g gendiff | g -v '  -6' > gendiff-2024-bbbb.txt to find genesis mismatches

* run c-9xtime-time2gen.py
--> edit the file directly to set the inventory
--> run by basin and after each meld adjustment run m-md3-csv-ALL.py 2024

# found bugs in mismatch between 9x in one shem basin for a NN in a
  different one

# most mismatches were an extra posit in the 9X-dev, i.e., gendiff = 0
  vice -6 for almost all the NHC storms

The most labor intensive was m-md3-qc-ALL.py to take out the kinks in
the tracks, also found diffs in 9x-sum.txt and NN-sum.txt

The whole think took about 7 h...
